# smilecdr Provider

Smile CDR is an HL7 FHIR resource server and database. It includes a SMART compliant Authorization Server. The focus of this
Terraform provider is to manage resources related to the authorization server. However, it does support general module configurations as well, of which resources ```smart_outbound_security``` and ```smart_inbound_security``` derive from. 

One thing to keep in mind when using this provider, is to incorporate any module unlocking and locking into your DevOps deployment scripting. This provider cannot modify locked modules. Additionally, you may need to restart the modules post configuration to have the changes take effect.
