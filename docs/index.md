# smilecdr Provider

The Smile CDR provider can be used to interact with [Smile Digital Health](https://www.smiledigitalhealth.com)'s Smile CDR Server. It currently supports OID Server configuration, OIDC client configuration and preview of general Module configurations. The emphasis for this provider is on the SMART authorization service configurations.

## Smile CDR Setup

If you have access to a Smile CDR docker image, you can use the docker-compose YAML file to setup, as found in the github repo for this provider.

## Basic Password Grant

The authentication currently supported to access Smile CDR Admin APIs uses Basic Auth with password.

1. Create or know an admin user account in Smile CDR. The default user account is admin with password as password. This is good for trying this out.  
2. Make sure your user has Smile CDR Admin Permissions.
3. The account is set in main.tf, and I recommend setting the secrets in tf-vars file.

## Assigning User Roles

Assign the user acount to the permission of Superuser (```ROLE_SUPERUSER```). You can also try reducing the user access by setting the permissions:

 - ```ACCESS_ADMIN_JSON```
 - ```ACCESS_ADMIN_WEB```
 - ```CONTROL_MODULE```
 - ```CREATE_USER```
 - ```MODULE_ADMIN```
 - ```OPENID_CONNECT_ADD_CLIENT```
 - ```OPENID_CONNECT_ADD_SERVER```
 - ```OPENID_CONNECT_EDIT_CLIENT```
 - ```OPENID_CONNECT_EDIT_SERVER```
 - ```OPENID_CONNECT_VIEW_CLIENT_LIST```
 - ```OPENID_CONNECT_VIEW_SERVER_LIST```
 - ```REINSTATE_MODULE```
 - ```UPDATE_MODULE_CONFIG```
- ```UPDATE_USER```
- ```VIEW_MODULE_CONFIG```
- ```VIEW_MODULE_STATUS```
- ```VIEW_USERS```
